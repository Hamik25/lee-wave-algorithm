# Lee wave algorithm

The Lee algorithm is one possible solution for maze routing problems based on Breadth-first search. 
In this implementation Lee's algorithm finds the shortest path between 2 points (A, B) in a 2D matrix. It is also called Wave algorithm. It always gives an optimal solution, if one exists, but is slow and requires considerable memory.
